What this paper is and is not:
------------------------------

It’s not trying to convince you we live in some kind of magic rainbow land where everyone is a good person and eats cupcakes.  It doesn’t even require that anyone is a good person. 

 It’s merely proposing that, for those who are into using social science to get this next generation less messed up than the last, it might worth a look to see who benefits from being treated as having the most positive qualities and working your way down; instead of assuming more dehumanizing qualities first.  People should be scientifically exploring every facet of everything. No matter how experienced a  prediction is, a predictions still doesn't count as exploring.

Abstract:
---------

 It’s very hard to take people in all at once without making at least some assumptions, especially when they behave in a sporadic, emotionally unstable ways.  Others often treat them as though something went wrong whilst they were acting on behalf of their core survival instincts,  core sexual drive, core fear of being alone, core fear of death, or core desire to be happy... ect. 

In this thesis I will propose an alternative “core” drive:  unmitigated selflessness.  Although very few people (or maybe even none at all) have this core drive, it may be better for some to start assuming a positive quality and give the person a chance to correct if there is a mistake.


####Theory of unmitigated selflessness states that:
 * A reasonable first approach is to assume people are driven by a positive quality.
 * A core unmitigated selfless drive is the most fitting positive quality to assume first.

Although there may be a mix reasons people do certain things, the theory of unmitigated selflessness doesn’t not dismiss them as non-existent.

####Differences:
> #####Mitigated selflessness:  
> “My loved ones don’t deserve the best, maybe 2nd, 3rd, good enough. ” or “my loved ones deserve the best, but I do not feel like putting myself in the best position to provide it.”
>
> #####Unmitigated selflessness: 
> “My loved ones deserve the best and I aim to getting in the best position to provide that for them, whatever it takes.”


What is the “best”?
-------------------

The theory of unmitigated selflessness holds, that, because people are sentient and mostly self sustained, the best way to help someone isn’t money, material things, or even shared experiences (although they might be a step forward), but the having the closeness and understanding to provide equal and understood input resulting in others changing their way of life.  Even though one could philosophize about what was the “best” for a good long time, some may (sub)consciously conclude with this definition.

Choosing one's “loved ones”:
----------------------------

Loving and trying to help everyone equally is less efficient than loving and helping your immediate family members.  The notion that “It’s ok just to worry about your loved ones, for now.  Everybody else has their own loved ones to depend on” is assumed.

When It comes to  your purpose being to help others, two semi-related factors come into play:

Factor 1 - impressiveness:
--------------------------
###Having qualities that would impress others, they might include:
 * successful
 * self sufficient
 * skilled
 * wise
 * precognitive
 * confident
 * attractive
 * honest
 * hardworking
 * chill
 * finding your own niche, et. 
 Perceptions could be accurate or inaccurate. 

Factor 2 - closeness:
---------------------
###How close you are in the relationship to provide the best. They can be split up between different levels:
 * Level 0: not in contact
 * Level 1:  contact
 * Level 2:  spending time with them
 * Level 3:  chatting
 * Level 4:  talking about issues and telling you what they would do based on their values. “here’s what I would do”
 * Level 5:  Talking about issues and them having curiosity towards your differences in values and why their solution might not match.
 * Level 6:  By virtue of having idea on your mind the other person knows it’s worth talking about and understanding completely.
 * Level 7:  By virtue of having something on your mind about how your loved one lives their life the other person feels it’s worth putting as much effort as it takes understanding completely and possibly changing.

#####An unmitigatedly selfless person might come into a great deal of roadblocks in their progress towards achieving the highest level of closeness (and, in turn, giving their loved one the best).  There are several strategies they can adopt in an attempt to overcome these roadblocks.  they can generally be split up into 2 categories,  meek (like children to parents, young to old,  student to teacher,  etc) and seasoned (like adult to child or adult to adult)##### 

Meek strategies:
----------------

###conformist submissive strategy: 
Impress those whom you wish to deliver the best by giving their rules and labels they assign your best shot. Hopefully they will be so impressed, they will be interested in understanding your ideas of who you want to be.

###deviant defiant strategy: 
communicate your frustration and desire to communicate by acting out.  Assuming they love you the same way you love them, they would be prepared to try everything to figure out what is wrong, including trying to open up the level of closeness and communication required for you to give them the best.

###Both strategies at once: 
due to cognitive dissonance and the added difficulty of trying to figure out exactly what you are thinking by yourself,  people may take of one strategy in one area of life and one in another.

###Conformist submissive literal:  
Follow the exact words of how they see you and the rules they define as if they were step by step instructions on getting close to them.

###Conformist submissive signaled:  
If conformist submissive literal isn’t getting you anywhere, you assume it would take something besides what they tell you to impress them.  If your relationship is not far along in levels of closeness, you have to try to pick of their cues and make guesses on ways to impress them.  If something doesn’t work, questions arise if you had the right cue, or if you didn’t try hard enough on your current one.   Might sometimes resemble the defiant defiant strategy.


Seasoned strategies:
--------------------

###Premature closeness:
with the theory of unmitigated selflessness holding that the awesomest way possible is to help them results in them being convinced to change; some are driven to resort to trying to change people before the other person feels close enough.  Some desperate actions might include making deals, threats, and other not entirely genuine tactics.  After experiencing this, some might see this as a good reason to change their definition of how to help someone the best way.

####External event dependence: 
Rely on forces outside your control to get closer:

-   #####initial:  
    make chance connections in the processes of trying to become more impressive, try out an identity to impress someone more seasoned, or trying to get close and/or help another, without specific deliberate effort to get close(unless that is what the identity you're trying out would do)

-   #####lasting: 
    the 2 peoples’ relationship, and current identities results in them unable to move forward in closeness by themselves.  They do not break off the relationship, however, and rely on chance events to bring them closer.

####Step by step: 
For those who know their personal requirements for others before they can get close, they give others the step by step instructions to achieve that outcome.  (I’ve never seen or heard anything like this, but it seems like a reasonable conclusion based on the above.)

Outcomes:

Desire to give an experience they don’t want: If a  meek person is currently using the “conformist submissive signaled” and a seasoned person uses of the “Premature Closeness” strategy, The meeker would resort to pretending they don’t care for closeness specifically so the other person would make the deal that if they changed, they would allow them be close.  They both get a twisted victory.  The “conformist submissive signaled” user gets closer, and the “premature closeness” user achieves an empty point in helping someone in the best way possible. 

Gritty self-destruction: eager to show their loved ones, and the world, just how much they are willing to give up and how hard they push themselves, they pour so much effort energy into a strategy or undesirable identity, they forget who they were before, and why they were doing it in the first place. Their old self is destroyed.

Punishment on behalf: Those who may be trying the identity of “bad person”, or have other core drives, but still hold much value in the way of selflessness, decide to punish those who would make life harder for the unmitigatedly selfless person.  Figuring out whether punishment is deserved is usually based on questions like “how much does this person know about me?”, “do they know enough to know if I’m a bad person?”,  “if they treat me like garbage, and don’t know that I’m a bad person, I should make life harder for them”


Pitch impression fog: The state of being lost and bewildered on telling when the effort to being impressive enough is finished or if you are being given another “test” for your impressiveness , and what to do when the game to impress is over.

impressiveness counter flow:   in a desperate attempt to impress others, some gritty self destruct their accountability to gain a perceived edge on their precognitive and confidence abilities.  They proceed to try to predict events or what is best for others, thinking that, if their predictions are accurate, they can leave others impressed enough to achieve a one sided closeness level of 6 (they would be interested in what other ideas are on your mind), despite their callus disinterest in other peoples way of life being counter to the golden rule,”treat others how you want to be treated”


Conclusions and Concrete Potential Answers:

Kids
Unmitigatedly selfless kids initially like complements of their impressiveness because they hope some form of extra closeness in addition to it.

Day to Day
It causes an a great deal more grief than those close to you might deserve to have your way of life closed off and unchangeable.  One should work to get to the point where they could imagine some way for someone to get close enough to help you in the “best” way.

A good way to spare others from mental issues is to work towards providing a step by step instructions on how others could raise their closeness levels with you.  

Treat others interactions as if their end goals are unmitigated selflessness.

Even though someone may already deserve to be close enough.  Just acknowledging something impressive about them and then before you intend to get closer might be a nice way to make sense of the harshness of the world.

Therapy
If you intend to help someone having problems, in a addition to treating it as if its their end goal, you should try to find something interesting in their problems that is of valuable  and  might change and improve yourself because of it.
